# Movie Recommendation Model (ML)
*A movie recommendation ML model.*

This repository contains the machine learning model for the Movie Recommendation System. The model powers personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences, trends, and other factors.

## Overview
The goal of this system is to recommend movies to users based on:
- User preferences (e.g., liked or favorited movies).
- Popular trends in specific locations (e.g., cities or countries).
- Collaborative filtering based on similar users' interests.
This ML service is part of a polyrepo setup, where the frontend and backend components are maintained separately.

## Features
- *Recommendation Engine*: Uses a combination of collaborative filtering and location-based trends to suggest movies.
- *Cold-Start Handling*: Provides recommendations to new users based on popular or trending movies.
- *Scalable Design*: Designed to scale with increasing user data and interactions.

## Project Structure
```

├── /scripts/             # Training scripts, data preprocessing, model evaluations
├── /model/               # Pre-trained models and model definitions

```

## How It Works
1. Data Collection: Collects user interactions, movie metadata, and location-based trends.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleans, preprocesses, and structures the data for training and model evaluation.
3. Training the Model: The model is trained using collaborative filtering techniques to predict user preferences.
4. Serving Recommendations: The model serves recommendations to the backend API, which is consumed by the frontend.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation.git
cd movie-recommendation

```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. Download datasets (e.g., from MovieLens or IMDb) and place them in the /data/ folder.

4. Train the model: Run the training script to build the recommendation model.
```
python scripts/train_model.py
```

5. Serve the model: The trained model can be served using an API to provide recommendations to the backend.
```
python scripts/serve_model.py
```

## Datasets
This model uses movie datasets such as:

- MovieLens Dataset
- IMDb Dataset

## Future Improvements
- *Contextual Recommendations*: Incorporating user context such as mood or time of day.
- *Improved Trend Analysis*: Enhancing the location-based recommendations by integrating real-time data.
- *Personalized User Embeddings*: Using deep learning techniques to better model user preferences.
